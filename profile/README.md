# A collection of my school cases, August 2020 - June 2022.

I'd say this is mainly an organization to see what I've learned during my education, starting in August 2020 with 0 experience of code.

The repositories are code-messy and not something I'd today proudly show to anyone. But during the cases I've learned a ton and after each deadline and presentation, I've always moved on to the next project feeling; I get it now, I could do this so much better.

I will not do changes to any repo here, more than maybe fixing some vital basics (like updating readMe or .gitignore files), even though my fingers is twitching and eyes bleeding when I scroll through them.

Still missing a couple of old cases, haven't been the most consistent user of github during some of them, but stay tuned - they're coming!
