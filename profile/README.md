# A collection of my school cases, August 2020 - June 2022.

I'd say this is mainly an organization to see what I've learned during my education, starting in August 2020 with 0 experience of code.

Most of the repositories are code-messy and not something I'd proudly show to anyone. But during the cases I've learned a ton and after each deadline and presentation, I've always moved on to the next project feeling; I get it now, I could do this so much better.

Still missing a couple of old cases, haven't been the most consistent user of github during some of them, but stay tuned - they're coming!
